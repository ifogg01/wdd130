    <h3>Hi Everyone</h3>
    <p> A little about me, I am 40 years old, but am still a kid who doesnâ€™t want to grow up. ðŸ˜Š I enjoy things like
        playing video games. Watching movies and playing guitar.
        I love all things geeky. I was into geek culture WAY before it became pop cultureâ€¦ Comic Books, Star Wars, LOTR,
        Harry Potterâ€¦ basically anything you might expect to find at comic-con, thatâ€™s me.
        I also have a passion for music, and art. I love to draw. I love rock music. \m/ (metal)
    </p>

        ... I live just outside of Salt Lake City with my wife and 4 kids, and our zoo of animals. We love animals,
        (mostly my wife) and have quite a few in our home. 2 cats, 2 dogs, a lizard, a parakeet, and chickens.
        We have also had several other animals over the years, guinea pigs, hedge hogs, tropical fish and a ton of
        fosters from local animal shelters.
        I served a mission in Baltimore Maryland back in 2001. I love the gospel and I love our Savior Jesus Christ, and
        although I am not perfect, I have a testimony in Him and His atonement.
        I am excited to take this class and to meet all of you â€¦ Cant wait to get to know some of you a little better.

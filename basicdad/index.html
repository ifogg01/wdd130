        <h2><br><br>Some of us had basic dads growing up. Some of us know basic dads now.
            Perhaps some of us have even slipped into being a basic dad without even knowing.
            For many guys, as we age, there is some worry about becoming this “basic dad.” <br> <br>We want to
            be a good parent,
            but don’t want to fit that stereotype of a goofy or weird or boring dad; as seen on many television
            shows.
            Maybe we want to take some of the values and lessons taught by our own dads, but we don’t want to be
            like him.
            Telling lame jokes. Worried about trivial things such as our lawn, or barbecuing or the thermostat
            temperature in our house.
            We want to be cooler, more modern, have better style. But the basic dad is not something to fear.
            <br><br>
            I say we should embrace the basic. Embrace all of those wonderful and quirky things (or dad-isms)
            that make a dad, a dad.
            Whether you think they are basic or not. These funny little stereo types should be celebrated and
            enjoyed.
            And as a man, WHEN it finally happens to you, take pride in your dad-isms.
            Know that you are laying groundwork for future generations of basic dads. Just as your father did
            for you. And his father did for him.
            And so on and so on.What are some of the things that make  a dad a basic dad? <br>
            Lets explore just a few.</h2>

                <h2>Ultimately, a basic dad is a man of character.
                    He is man of wisdom and experience. He is a man of discipline. He is dependable. He has a good
                    heart. He
                    wants to be a good citizen and neighbor.
                    He may be somewhat embarrassing to his family but he loves his family and wants to be a role
                    model
                    for his
                    kids.
                    The basic dad wants the world in his own little sphere of influence, to be a little bit better
                    because of
                    him. He is a good man.</h2>

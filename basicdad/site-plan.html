      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Guys, have you ever worried about becoming a “basic dad?” Or that you may some day turn into your own dad? Whether you have no kids or several, the reality is that this could happen to you. Rather than fear the basic dad, I say that men should embrace this idea. As a father of 4 who struggled with these same types of questions, I have grown to love the quirkiness that is everything “dad.”
        My idea is simple. I want to create a site that is comical. One that will celebrate some of the fun eccentricities of the basic dad life. Perhaps in the future this could branch out into something more substantial or commercialized. However, to start, this would just be a fun and humorous fan-site to highlight the comedy of basic dads.
        </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p> Young Dads, Old Dads, and Prospective Dads are the main focus for the site.
        While the target audience here is dads, (especially those who are opposed to "basic dads" and "dad-isms") 
        this site could potentially appeal to anyone.
        Wives and children of dads may also find this site humorous.

      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
